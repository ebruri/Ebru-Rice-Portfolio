          <h1 class="card-title">About Me</h1>
          <p class="card-text">I was first introduced to coding at university 10 years ago. While pursuing a major in Information Management & Library Science, I became really interested in the field and wanted to pursue a career in programming/coding. Little that I knew, life would put me on a different path. I ended up working at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, as a consular employee. As much as I enjoyed working there, I never lost my interest in coding. After meeting somebody that went through a coding bootcamp, I decided to take action on my interest. </p>
